Hi everyone! I basically made this page so that I could document the progress of some of the projects I make in my free time. I've been wanting to create a blog like this ever since I started undergrad at UCSD, but unfortunately, never got the chance. [[I actually started a blog on [Blogger](http://kl0721.blogspot.com) for one of my first projects at UCSD, but posted very minimally (i.e. one post)]]. However, now that I'm entering the industry, I thought - here's my chance!

Anywho, I'm going to be breaking this blog down into two categories of projects - long term projects and their progress as well as easier, 
short term, weekend projects. I will mostly be using this blog to write about my progress for a list of projects I've been 
working on, as well as keep track of my own personal improvement. 

Depending on how busy I end up being, I'll start posting projects soon.
