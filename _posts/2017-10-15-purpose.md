Hi everyone!

I basically made this page so that I could document some of the projects I make in my free time. I've been wanting
to create a blog like this ever I started undergrad at UCSD, but for some reason never got the chance. I think I actually started a blog
on Blogger for one of my first projects at UCSD, but never really posted on it. But here's my chance!

Anywho, I'm going to be breaking this blog down into two categories of projects - long term projects and their progress as well as easier, 
short term, weekend projects. I will mostly be using this blog as motivation to document my progress for a list of projects I've been 
meaning to work on, as well as keep track of my improvement. 

Depending on how busy I end up being, I will start posting projects next weekend (10/21).
